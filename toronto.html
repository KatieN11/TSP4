      Well, the answer is actually quite simple. As you know, my first Taylor
      Swift Concert experience was June 30th, 2023 in Cincinnati. Ever since the
      day after that show ended, I have been trying to find a way to go back. My
      sister, who went with me to Cincinnati, was the one who originally got me
      into your music, so I knew if I was going to go again, I would need to
      bring her. I spent about a year trying to convince my parents that this
      was a good idea, and that there was use in going to see a concert multiple
      times, especially when the setlist had been changed so drastically. I have
      watched every show on livestream, waited for presale codes I never got,and
      I stalked resale sites with notifcations for when tickets dropped below a
      certain price. Last summer, I got a new job so that I could finance this
      desire. Eventually, I bought Toronto Tickets for November 14th - the only
      day that aligned with both me and my sister's schedule. I bought the
      tickets right after I submitted my early action college application..
      because.. maybe sometimes, everything can work out...??
