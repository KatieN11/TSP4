        You Had It Figured Out Since you were In School, Everybody Loves Pretty

    <p>
      You have proven one of the best role models I have ever looked up to. I
      know you probably hear this a lot, but that’s only because it’s true. You
      are endlessly inspiring, and your humble and kind demeanor is palpable and
      admirable. It is obvious, without even knowing you, that you light up
      every room you walk into. I mean, you never fail to put a smile on my
      face. But, as a role model, you have taught me the value of
      self-sufficiency, confidence, and drive in achieving one’s goals. You
      always stand up for yourself, and come back stronger. You show me that
      drive is necessary for success, and you have shown me that success is
      possible with confidence, passion, and perseverance, traits I write about
      frequently in my plethora of college applications. One of my dreams is to
      be apart of something larger than me: to help people through medical
      research. You constantly remind me that my dreams are possible, despite
      whatever struggles I may face along the way. You help me see my own
      capability.
    </p>

    <p>
      Everyday you inspire me to work hard, to be humble, to not take life too
      seriously, and to grow from my own mistakes. You and your music also helps
      me think introspecitvely, learning through my mistakes about myself.
      Whether it's solving a difficult calculus problem or going for a 20 mile
      run, I know I will have you and your music every step of the way. More
      importantly, you allowed me to know I will also have myself to get me
      through every hurdle, and that at the end of the day I may be on my own,
      but that I am all I'll ever need.
