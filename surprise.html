      Hint: the three letter pages: escape, fandom, and role model, all have an
      interesting title. The title has a number, a track number (or numbers). Do
      not add them. Its a password, not a single number. no spaces.

        A surprise, well, what even could my surprise to you be? Although
        underwhelming and way overdue, here is the fan project video I made LAST
        YEAR for your birthday. Just think of it as an early birthday gift for
        this year.

        (Also, I am sorry it's a youtube link. I tried to put the video directly
        into the code, but the file was too large.)
