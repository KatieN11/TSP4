    <p>My dearest Taylor,</p>
    <p>
      My name is Katie, and I am currently a senior in high school living in the
      suburbs surrounding Cleveland. I love math and science, and plan to pursue
      a career in biomedical engineering. I do figure skating and synchronized
      ice skating. I am also cross country captain and a marathoner. I always
      prioritize potential and trying to push it, and in that you serve as both
      a role model, an escape, and a home.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I had to describe the past year and a half in one word it would be
      drowning. I am drowning: under the pressure of the standards I set for
      myself: to run fast, far, to get the best grades and do the most research
      , and to be the best friend I can be. A petty problem, one may say, and I
      agree, but these standards, college applications, and the constant “doing”
      that is my life is crushing, and many times I feel like I am running a
      race I can’t win, with every step the finish line gets pushed back twenty.
      I would’ve gone under, but you swept into the rescue (like the albatross
      one could say)...
    </p>
    <p>
      This is why I say you have provided me with an escape. I use music -
      specifically yours- to get me through each and every day. It is the
      playlists I listen to while doing work, usually my folkmore playlist
      “taylor in the trees, taylor in the weeds” (appropriately named from
      seven, my favorite song of yours), folklore the long pond studio sessions
      (can’t you see I kinda like folklore, maybe just a little...), or a mix I
      like to call “revermore”- a shuffle of red and evermore together. I also
      listen to your music while I run: whether it’s a “reputation run” on the
      track, or a day I pull out Apple music’s “Taylor Swift: Fitness +
      Spotlight” playlist, you were the (only) artist I listened to while
      training for both my 2023 half marathon and 2024 full marathon, as I made
      a specific running playlist to be my “Eras Tour” as I ran for up to 4.5
      hours at a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your music, however, is not only the soundtrack of my life, but the door
      that allows me to escape to my secret gardens. Like I said, a lot of the
      time I feel like I am drowning, so I use your music as a portal to allow
      me to escape into worlds of fantasy, seemingly separate from my own life.
      I find solace in these daydreams and I allow your music to drive the plot
      and focus of nearly all of them. However, looking under the superficial
      fantasy of these daydreams reveals an intersection between fantasy and the
      feelings underlying my real life, a gap bridged by your music. Your music,
      through intricately and meticulously crafted lyrics makes a bridge between
      words, thought, and feeling, and it is in this that I see that the
      connection between my fantasies, your music, and my real life is one of
      emotion. Your music allows me to understand myself and every feeling, to
      put those emotions and even memories into words that I then carry with me
      and learn from forever. I can proudly say I am more emotionally
      intelligent and connected to myself and the word around me because of the
      music you have provided, the introspection upon your own life allowing me
      to think introspectively about mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your music has been there for me: to understand me and to help me
      understand myself when nothing else has been. I truly do not know the
      person I would be without it, and neither do I want to. I know that, no
      matter how hard it gets, no matter what goes awry, I will always have your
      music and you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your art allows me to find comfort in being sad, melancholy, and anxious,
      and to also find comfort in the fact that those types of feelings and
      experiences will help you grow. Then, you realize that, no matter how
      comforting those secret gardens and daydreams may be, at the end of the
      day you’re on your own, and your secret gardens won’t save you. But, that
      you are all you need anyways. Thank you will never be enough for the
      comfort and insight.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I have learned anything from being a swiftie, it is that every person
      who listens to your songs can take vastly different things away from the
      same lyrics. But, your music also spreads common themes, bridges gaps
      between people,and allows so many people to find unity in a sphere of
      endless loneliness. The community I found in this fandom is something I am
      endlessly grateful for, and I cannot imagine my life without it. I once
      tried to be the best 'swifite', the ones who - when people thought of
      Taylor Swift - they would think of me. However, all the special
      experiences I have had as a “swiftie ” would be mitigated without the
      people I have shared them with.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the end of the day, being a swiftie is not about who listens to the
      most music, or who knows the most niche easter eggs, but rather the
      friendships with people across the world I rekindled due to a sharing the
      interest: the ones who I text and watch every grainy livestream with. It’s
      about when me and my sister tested our hair, outfits, and makeup ideas the
      day before our first eras tour show in Cincinnati, more excited than ever.
      It’s about talking my friends’ ears off about you or your music, making
      them watch ‘Miss Americana’ and ‘The Reputation Stadium Tour’. It’s
      watching the Chiefs with my dad every week. It’s making bracelets and
      trading them to people I don’t know. It’s taking a photo with the girl I
      met on the floor at the Cincinnati Eras Tour show who also had a dexcom
      for type 1 diabetes management- like me. It’s meeting people and learning
      about them, and watching the Grammys and VMAS with them. Its clowning and
      listening to new songs: TTPD, The Speak Now and 1989 vault tracks, and so
      much more. It’s getting to clown about announcments, and learning to
      appreciate the people in the community the way I appreciate you.
    </p>
    <p>
      To me, it doesn’t matter when someone became a fan, it only matters how we
      can come together to support one another and how your art has provided the
      ground for so many people to come together in a safe space, a home. Our
      fandom is far from perfect, like any fandom is, but there are some really
      special people I have found becuase of you - some of my best friends. It’s
      these people and this home that allows you to truly let go and live life
      (The trick to holding on, you could say). This safe space given me the
      confidence to go to the move theater in a full costume. But, it has also
      given me a world to fall back on when I lost a friend, a place where I
      could admit that I had been hurt and hurt her. Your music provides a wall
      to fall back on, a support system created by a beautifully unique and
      collective experience that is being in a fandom and connecting to
      someone’s music so deeply. Thank you again for that.
    </p>
    <p>
      You have proven one of the best role models I have ever looked up to. I
      know you probably hear this a lot, but that’s only because it’s true. You
      are endlessly inspiring, and your humble and kind demeanor is palpable and
      admirable. It is obvious, without even knowing you, that you light up
      every room you walk into. I mean, you never fail to put a smile on my
      face. But, as a role model, you have taught me the value of
      self-sufficiency, confidence, and drive in achieving one’s goals. You
      always stand up for yourself, and come back stronger. You show me that
      drive is necessary for success, and you have shown me that success is
      possible with confidence, passion, and perseverance, traits I write about
      frequently in my plethora of college applications. One of my dreams is to
      be apart of something larger than me: to help people through medical
      research. You constantly remind me that my dreams are possible, despite
      whatever struggles I may face along the way. You help me see my own
      capability.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Everyday you inspire me to work hard, to be humble, to not take life too
      seriously, and to grow from my own mistakes. You and your music also helps
      me think introspecitvely, learning through my mistakes about myself.
      Whether it's solving a difficult calculus problem or going for a 20 mile
      run, I know I will have you and your music every step of the way. More
      importantly, you allowed me to know I will also have myself to get me
      through every hurdle, and that at the end of the day I may be on my own,
      but that I am all I'll ever need.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thank you, although thank you will never truly be enough to describe how
      much you and your art has changed me and how much you mean to me. It’s
      weird, I know, because I don’t know you and probably never will, but you
      have still left a deep impression on who I am and who I will be. Thank you
      so much Taylor. Thanks for being endlessly amazing. I have so many more
      things that I could tell you, and a thousand thank yous and a thousand
      more words would still be fruitless in describing how truly important you
      are to me. Thank you for coloring my world, for making my life what it is,
      for giving me the best experiences of my entire life, and for helping me
      discover who I am. I love you the moon and to saturn, endlessly, forever
      and always.
    </p>
    <p>
      I truly wish you the best in everything you do,and happiness and love in
      every day. You deserve nothing short of the whole world. I am grateful we
      got to cross paths at least once, even if from afar. (but who knows, maybe
      I will see you at the Chiefs game in Cleveland on December 15 ???)
    </p>
