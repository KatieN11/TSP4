    <p>
      Thank you, although thank you will never truly be enough to describe how
      much you and your art has changed me and how much you mean to me. It’s
      weird, I know, because I don’t know you and probably never will, but you
      have still left a deep impression on who I am and who I will be. Thank you
      so much Taylor. Thanks for being endlessly amazing. I have so many more
      things that I could tell you, and a thousand thank yous and a thousand
      more words would still be fruitless in describing how truly important you
      are to me. Thank you for coloring my world, for making my life what it is,
      for giving me the best experiences of my entire life, and for helping me
      discover who I am. I love you the moon and to saturn, endlessly, forever
      and always.
    </p>
    <p>
      I truly wish you the best in everything you do,and happiness and love in
      every day. You deserve nothing short of the whole world. I am grateful we
      got to cross paths at least once, even if from afar. (but who knows, maybe
      I will see you at the Chiefs game in Cleveland on December 15 ???)
    </p>

    <h4>
      It is because of you that I can proudly say, “when I was drowning, that’s
      when I could finally breathe”… "I think I am finally clean”
    </h4>
    <br />
    <p>thank you endlessly and much love,</p>
