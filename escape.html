        If I had to describe the past year and a half in one word it would be
        drowning. I am drowning: under the pressure of the standards I set for
        myself: to run fast, far, to get the best grades and do the most
        research , and to be the best friend I can be. A petty problem, one may
        say, and I agree, but these standards, college applications, and the
        constant “doing” that is my life is crushing, and many times I feel like
        I am running a race I can’t win, with every step the finish line gets
        pushed back twenty. I would’ve gone under, but you swept into the rescue
        (like the albatross one could say)...
      </p>

      <p>
        This is why I say you have provided me with an escape. I use music -
        specifically yours- to get me through each and every day. It is the
        playlists I listen to while doing work, usually my folkmore playlist
        “taylor in the trees, taylor in the weeds” (appropriately named from
        seven, my favorite song of yours), folklore the long pond studio
        sessions (can’t you see I kinda like folklore, maybe just a little...),
        or a mix I like to call “revermore”- a shuffle of red and evermore
        together. I also listen to your music while I run: whether it’s a
        “reputation run” on the track, or a day I pull out Apple music’s “Taylor
        Swift: Fitness + Spotlight” playlist, you were the (only) artist I
        listened to while training for both my 2023 half marathon and 2024 full
        marathon, as I made a specific running playlist to be my “Eras Tour” as
        I ran for up to 4.5 hours at a time.

        Your music, however, is not only the soundtrack of my life, but the door
        that allows me to escape to my secret gardens. Like I said, a lot of the
        time I feel like I am drowning, so I use your music as a portal to allow
        me to escape into worlds of fantasy, seemingly separate from my own
        life. I find solace in these daydreams and I allow your music to drive
        the plot and focus of nearly all of them. However, looking under the
        superficial fantasy of these daydreams reveals an intersection between
        fantasy and the feelings underlying my real life, a gap bridged by your
        music. Your music, through intricately and meticulously crafted lyrics
        makes a bridge between words, thought, and feeling, and it is in this
        that I see that the connection between my fantasies, your music, and my
        real life is one of emotion. Your music allows me to understand myself
        and every feeling, to put those emotions and even memories into words
        that I then carry with me and learn from forever. I can proudly say I am
        more emotionally intelligent and connected to myself and the word around
        me because of the music you have provided, the introspection upon your
        own life allowing me to think introspectively about mine.
      </p>

      <p>
        Your music has been there for me: to understand me and to help me
        understand myself when nothing else has been. I truly do not know the
        person I would be without it, and neither do I want to. I know that, no
        matter how hard it gets, no matter what goes awry, I will always have
        your music and you.
      </p>

      <p>
        Your art allows me to find comfort in being sad, melancholy, and
        anxious, and to also find comfort in the fact that those types of
        feelings and experiences will help you grow. Then, you realize that, no
        matter how comforting those secret gardens and daydreams may be, at the
        end of the day you’re on your own, and your secret gardens won’t save
        you. But, that you are all you need anyways. Thank you will never be
        enough for the comfort and insight.
