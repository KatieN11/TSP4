    <p>
      If I have learned anything from being a swiftie, it is that every person
      who listens to your songs can take vastly different things away from the
      same lyrics. But, your music also spreads common themes, bridges gaps
      between people,and allows so many people to find unity in a sphere of
      endless loneliness. The community I found in this fandom is something I am
      endlessly grateful for, and I cannot imagine my life without it. I once
      tried to be the best 'swifite', the ones who - when people thought of
      Taylor Swift - they would think of me. However, all the special
      experiences I have had as a “swiftie ” would be mitigated without the
      people I have shared them with.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the end of the day, being a swiftie is not about who listens to the
      most music, or who knows the most niche easter eggs, but rather the
      friendships with people across the world I rekindled due to a sharing the
      interest: the ones who I text and watch every grainy livestream with. It’s
      about when me and my sister tested our hair, outfits, and makeup ideas the
      day before our first eras tour show in Cincinnati, more excited than ever.
      It’s about talking my friends’ ears off about you or your music, making
      them watch ‘Miss Americana’ and ‘The Reputation Stadium Tour’. It’s
      watching the Chiefs with my dad every week. It’s making bracelets and
      trading them to people I don’t know. It’s taking a photo with the girl I
      met on the floor at the Cincinnati Eras Tour show who also had a dexcom
      for type 1 diabetes management- like me. It’s meeting people and learning
      about them, and watching the Grammys and VMAS with them. Its clowning and
      listening to new songs: TTPD, The Speak Now and 1989 vault tracks, and so
      much more. It’s getting to clown about announcments, and learning to
      appreciate the people in the community the way I appreciate you.
    </p>
    <p>
      To me, it doesn’t matter when someone became a fan, it only matters how we
      can come together to support one another and how your art has provided the
      ground for so many people to come together in a safe space, a home. Our
      fandom is far from perfect, like any fandom is, but there are some really
      special people I have found becuase of you - some of my best friends. It’s
      these people and this home that allows you to truly let go and live life
      (The trick to holding on, you could say). This safe space given me the
      confidence to go to the move theater in a full costume. But, it has also
      given me a world to fall back on when I lost a friend, a place where I
      could admit that I had been hurt and hurt her. Your music provides a wall
      to fall back on, a support system created by a beautifully unique and
      collective experience that is being in a fandom and connecting to
      someone’s music so deeply. Thank you again for that.

        Tara is one of my internet friends. She lives in Norway and loves you
        just as much as I do. She went to Amsterdam N1, planned to go to Vienna
        N1 and N2, and London N8. We reconnected over your music.
